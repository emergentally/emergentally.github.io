Day-to-day management of the system and all data entry is undertaken by MFDP, and the Dashboard is now hosted on Liberian government servers. Funding ongoing development and adding new features, to maintain the relevance of the system in an evolving policy context, is also to some extent about the value proposition: stakeholders will invest in a system if it is delivering value. But it is also about minimising the cost, which we are doing through offering the system in other countries and contexts.
