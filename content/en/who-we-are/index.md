# Who we are

Emergentally works with civil servants, policy-makers and Development Partners to address their development challenges. We develop a deep understanding of the political economy of the countries we work in, which we combine with technical, data, and software development skills. Working with Liberia’s Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP), we developed the Liberia Project Dashboard, which is currently the only country system in the world which automatically updates financial data from IATI. We’re now ready to offer the Dashboard in other countries.

Emergentally was founded by Mark Brough. Mark is an economist and software developer with more than a
decade of experience working with governments, donors and civil society. His focus has long been on how to use data to make the best use of scarce resources. He has worked on a diverse range of issues around aid management, Public Financial Management (PFM) and governance. He has worked in Bangladesh, France, Georgia, Germany, Liberia, Myanmar, Rwanda, the US, and the UK.

We work with developers based in the region our customers are based in.
