# What we do

Working with Liberia's Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, we developed the [Liberia Project Dashboard](https://liberiaprojects.org), an innovative system which transforms the management of aid and public investment management in the country.

The Dashboard is currently <b>the only system in the world</b> which automatically updates financial data from donors &ndash; significantly increasing data quality and the sustainability of the system. It's lightweight and user friendly, but has a wide range of features to meet the needs of emerging economies.

## Developed with civil servants and policy-makers
A fast and user-friendly interface helps civil servants keep data up to date, providing the information and insights which senior policy-makers need to make <b>informed decisions</b>.

## Integrated with <abbr title="Public Financial Management">PFM</abbr> processes
Financial data for government-funded projects can be updated by uploading data from <abbr title="Integrated Financial Management Information System">IFMIS</abbr>. Data can be exported in the format needed for the budget process. We're working towards making the data useful for debt management.

## Monitoring and improving project performance
Advanced features allow a wide variety of results information to be captured in the Dashboard. Projects with low disbursement rates can be highlighted to indicate which projects need attention to <b>improve performance</b>.

## Automatically updating financial data
For donor-financed projects, the world's most advanced <abbr title="International Aid Transparency Initiative">IATI</abbr> integration makes it possible to keep financial data up to date automatically, substantially improving data quality and reducing the burden of data collection.
