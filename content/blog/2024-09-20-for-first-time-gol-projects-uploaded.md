The Government of Liberia has published [government-funded projects](https://liberiaprojects.org/activities?domestic_external=domestic) for the first time on the Liberia Project Dashboard. The use of the system promotes transparency and accountability in the development and implementation of aid programs and projects.

Making remarks at the first publication of government projects and programs on the dashboard, Deputy Minister for Economic Management, Hon. Dehpue Zuo, noted that the first publication shows the government commitment to transparency and accountability by informing the Liberian people across the country on how projects and programs are implemented. “We want you to know how government money is collected and spent for development purposes across the country”, Minister Zuo explains.

The new information covers data on ten Public Sector Investment Projects funded as part of the new administration’s [100 Day Deliverables agenda](http://liberiaprojects.org/reports/100-days). It includes data on financial appropriations, as well as the planned and actual results of each project.
