The Government of Liberia presented the Liberia Project Dashboard at a High-Level Side Event at the United Nations, emphasising its position as the world-leading development management solution.

In early February, IATI hosted a successful [side-event at the United Nations](https://iatistandard.org/en/news/iati-convenes-high-level-roundtable-ffd4/) convening over 100 stakeholders on the importance of transparency for development outcomes. The event was held as part of efforts to ensure the Financing for Development Conference (FfD4) explicitly recognises IATI as part of this process. The Government of Liberia was represented alongside the Governments of Australia and Germany, the Open Contracting Partnership (OCP), and World Bank and Global Alliance for Food Security (GAFS).

Liberia demonstrated how it has fully integrated IATI data into its national budget system, leveraging open data to improve fiscal planning, project management, and donor coordination, on an ongoing basis, now for eight of its largest development partners. By using IATI’s timely, relevant, granular, project-level data, Liberia ensures better oversight and alignment of aid.

The side event also gave a preview of the [Liberia Project Dashboard](https://liberiaprojects.org/), developed by Emergentally, which was demonstrated by Sarah McGill Mulbah, Assistant Minister of Budget, Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, Government of Liberia.

The Liberia Project Dashboard was developed by Emergentally and is the first system in the world to import IATI data on an ongoing basis. It has since been adopted by the Government of Nigeria. [Read more about the Development Dashboard.](/development-dashboard/)
