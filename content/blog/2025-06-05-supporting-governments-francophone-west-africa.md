Emergentally facilitated [a three-day workshop from 3 to 5 June](https://iatistandard.org/en/news/afdb-iati-west-africa-workshop/) in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, with francophone participants from Côte d’Ivoire, Benin, Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, and Togo. The workshop was co-hosted by the African Development Bank and the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI). Participants shared their development information needs and practical challenges with using IATI data.

We provided hands-on training with using IATI data, and then created space for country governments to engage with development partners, including the African Development Bank, Agence Française de Développement, Islamic Development Bank, West African Development Bank (BOAD), and the World Bank.

The workshop created a dialogue between country governments and development partners, with the aim of shifting conversations on data quality to practical and specific discussions with clear recommendations. The workshop concluded with an action plan to enhance the use of IATI data at the country level in francophone west Africa.
